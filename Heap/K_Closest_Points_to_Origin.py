K Closest Points to Origin

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).


Understand
- Given array of points (x,y) and k, return k closest points to the origin (0,0)
    - can return the points in any order
- Distance is calculated by sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
- [(-2,2), (1,3)]
    - sqrt((-2)^2 + (2)^2) = sqrt(8)
    - sqrt((1)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(10)
    - sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), closer
    - k = 1, return [[-2,2]]
- What if the distances are the same?
    - choose any one
- What if k > # of points?
    - return empty?
- What if there's duplicate points?
    - count the duplicates

Match
- List Traversal

Plan 1 - Use Dictionary
- create new list to store the result
- create a dictionary where the keys are the points and value are the distance from the origin
- iterate through array of points
    - calculate the distance from the origin, store in dictionary
- iterate through dictionary
    - while len(list) <= k
        - append the lowest distance point to the list
- return list
- Problem: Duplicate keys aren't allowed in dictionaries

Plan 2 - Use Heap
- create list for heap
- create list for the result we're going to return
- calculate the distance and store it in the list: (distance, x, y)
- heapify the list so its becomes structure of a heap
- start popping off the values and append it to the result
